#guessing game
#Task: 1. Build a number-guessing game. when I come in as user I would run the code from my IDE. When I Run the code
#1. it will ask for my name.
#When I enter my name
#2. It will ask me to guess a number.
#When I type in a number it will tell me if I’m hot or if I’m cold.
#Hot => means I'm getting close to the right number.
#Cold => means I’m far from guessing the right number.

#When I guess the right number it will tell I won after X tries. X being the number of guesses I made.
#Then it will ask if I want to play again or leave the game.

#N.B: every time I play the game I get a random number to guess
